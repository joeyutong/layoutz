**Composable layouts for beautiful CLI output ðŸª¶âœ¨**

Build declarative & composable sections, trees, tables and dashboards for your console outputs. Part of [d4](https://github.com/mattlianje/d4)

## Of note...
- With LLM's, boilerplate code that "spaces", "pads", "formats" and "pretty-prints" is **_cheaper than ever_**...
- Which is why, **_more than ever_**, this boilerplate "string formatting code" is spawning, duplicating and becoming muddled with domain logic
- **layoutz** is just a tiny, declarative DSL to combat this
